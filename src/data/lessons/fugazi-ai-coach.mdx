# AI Coach (Post-Match Analysis Only)

Fugazi includes an AI-powered analysis system designed to help players understand their performance after each completed match. The AI Coach operates strictly in a retrospective capacity and is invoked only after match resolution. It analyzes completed match data to generate structured, explanatory feedback that helps players contextualize outcomes, identify decision patterns, and compare their performance against opponents under the same conditions. The AI Coach does not interact with players during live competition, does not provide forward-looking guidance, and does not influence match outcomes. By limiting the system to post-match analysis, Fugazi ensures that learning and improvement are supported without introducing external influence, advisory ambiguity, or competitive imbalance.

After match resolution, the AI Coach generates a structured performance summary that may include:

- A breakdown of key decision points
- Relative comparisons between player and opponent actions
- Observations on timing, exposure, and consistency
- High-level insights into what contributed to the final outcome

The AI Coach is explicitly constrained in scope. It does not:

- Provide forward-looking predictions
- Recommend specific assets, trades, or strategies
- Interact with players during active matches
- Persist memory across matches or build a personalized advisory profile

Each analysis instance is generated using match-specific data and is discarded after delivery. This ensures consistency, prevents drift, and avoids the creation of an ongoing advisory relationship.

The purpose of the AI Coach is educational and explanatory — to help players learn from completed competitions, contextualize outcomes, and improve future decision-making — without altering gameplay or introducing external influence into the competitive process.
