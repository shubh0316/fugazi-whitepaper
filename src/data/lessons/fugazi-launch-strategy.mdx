# Launch Strategy & Jurisdiction Awareness

Fugazi is designed with jurisdiction awareness as a first-class architectural principle. Platform features and monetization capabilities are governed by location-based rules to ensure compliant operation across different regulatory environments.

At launch, Fugazi will operate as a social competition platform, with virtual competition tokens and non-financial progression systems available only in jurisdictions where such models are permitted. Certain jurisdictions may be restricted or excluded entirely based on local legal frameworks.

## Key elements of the launch strategy include:

- **Geo-aware feature gating** — platform capabilities are enabled or disabled based on user location
- **Hard-blocked jurisdictions** — regions with restrictive interpretations of competitive or virtual currency mechanics may be excluded
- **Transparent user experience** — users are clearly informed when features are unavailable due to location-based restrictions

Jurisdiction awareness is implemented at the platform level rather than through ad hoc enforcement. Location checks occur at account creation and during active sessions, ensuring consistent application of rules as users move between regions.

This approach allows Fugazi to launch broadly while maintaining flexibility to expand, restrict, or modify feature availability as regulatory landscapes evolve, without disrupting the core competitive experience.
