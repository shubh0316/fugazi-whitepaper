# Frequently Asked Questions

## Q: Is this just a game?

**A:** Fugazi is a competitive system designed to measure skill under controlled conditions. The game mechanics create engagement, but the underlying value is the standardized, repeatable measurement of decision quality.

## Q: How do you solve the cold start problem?

**A:** We target dense, high-intent cohorts and embed distribution into competition. Social sharing and direct challenges collapse discovery and participation into a single step.

## Q: Why don't you need real money to drive engagement?

**A:** Competitive status, reputation, and progression drive sustained engagement in every successful ladder-based system (esports, chess, DFS free-to-play). Fugazi applies the same mechanics to markets.

## Q: What happens in a low-volatility market?

**A:** Engagement is driven by ranking and competition, not price direction. Rulesets and championships reward adaptability rather than volatility alone.

## Q: Why won't this be dominated by sharks?

**A:** Protected onboarding brackets, ranking volatility controls, and matchmaking bands prevent early skill cliffs and preserve retention across experience levels.

## Q: Why is Phase 2 real-stakes optional?

**A:** Because Fugazi is designed to scale and monetize independently. Phase 2 exists as leverage, not justification.

## Q: What would make you not pursue Phase 2?

**A:** If retention, liquidity, or skill signal integrity fail to meet defined thresholds, we do not escalate complexity.

## Q: What's the biggest real risk?

**A:** Marketplace liquidity and competitive integrity — both of which are addressed structurally and monitored through early warning indicators and kill criteria.
