# Overview

![Fugazi|1200x675](/fugazi.png)

Fugazi is a skill-based competition platform where players prove market decision-making ability through head-to-head matches built on real-world market data. Players compete using simulated portfolios under identical conditions, with outcomes determined strictly by relative performance within a standardized ruleset.

Fugazi turns markets into a competitive arena — not by enabling trading, custody, or execution, but by translating price movement into a fair, repeatable game environment where skill can be measured. Every match is governed by fixed constraints and deterministic scoring. This removes common distortions in "market performance" such as capital size, leverage, execution infrastructure, and access advantages.

Fugazi supports multiple competitive formats, with early focus on short, live-resolved matches that deliver immediate feedback and repeatable engagement.

Fugazi is designed for players who already pay attention to markets and want a structured way to compete, improve, and build reputation. At the platform level, Fugazi's long-term value compounds through the skill-rating layer and the match dataset: a standardized record of short-horizon decision performance under controlled conditions.

## Important Terms

**Liquidity (aka Participation Density)**  
The presence of sufficient concurrent players to support reliable matchmaking across skill bands and rulesets. Participation density refers to player availability, not financial capital.

**Competition / Match**  
A head-to-head engagement between players conducted under standardized rules using simulated portfolios, resulting in a deterministic outcome.

**Simulated Portfolio**  
A non-custodial, non-financial representation of positions used solely for scoring and comparison purposes. No real assets are traded, held, or transferred.

**Skill Rating**  
A persistent, Elo-inspired measure of a player's relative performance over time, designed to reflect consistent decision-making quality rather than isolated outcomes.

**Social Competition Model**  
A monetization and engagement framework in which participation, progression, and reputation are decoupled from real-world financial value or prizes.

**Participation Monetization**  
Revenue generated from access, identity, or analytical enhancements that do not influence competitive outcomes or confer in-match advantages.

**Fugazi Tokens**  
Fugazi Tokens are non-transferable, non-redeemable, platform-bound participation units used solely to access competitions and features within the Fugazi platform. Fugazi Tokens have no cash value, are not a cryptocurrency or digital asset, and do not function as a measure of skill, performance, or ranking.

**Competitive Integrity**  
The assurance that outcomes are fair, explainable, and resistant to manipulation, collusion, or abuse, supported by system design and enforcement mechanisms.

**Phase 1 — Social Competition Platform**  
The initial and primary product stage of Fugazi. Phase 1 encompasses the full free-to-play and virtual token-based competitive platform described in this document, including all match formats, the Skill Rating system, progression mechanics, AI Coach analysis, and social distribution infrastructure. Phase 1 is a complete, standalone product with its own growth trajectory, revenue model, and long-term value. Fugazi's success is defined and measured at the Phase 1 level.

**Phase 2 — Real-Stakes Competitive Product (Optional Expansion)**  
A potential future offering, structurally separate from Phase 1, in which participants may compete for real financial prizes using the proven mechanics, integrity systems, and skill infrastructure developed during Phase 1. Phase 2 is explicitly optional, independently structured, and gated behind empirical validation of Phase 1 retention, liquidity, and skill signal integrity. The development and launch of Phase 2 is not a condition of Fugazi's success and will not be pursued unless Phase 1 demonstrates the foundational metrics defined in Section 13.
