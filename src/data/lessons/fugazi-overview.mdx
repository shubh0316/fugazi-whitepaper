## Executive Summary

Fugazi is a deterministic competitive platform designed to measure market decision-making skill under controlled conditions.

Participants compete head-to-head using simulated portfolios built on standardized real-world market data. Every match operates within identical constraints, identical pricing inputs, and predefined scoring logic. Outcomes are resolved algorithmically and reproducibly, eliminating execution advantages, capital asymmetry, and discretionary settlement.

Fugazi isolates decision quality.

Skill is expressed through a bounded 0–1000 ranking system that converges over repeated competition. A structured diamond-based tier framework provides stable competitive identity, while weekly ladders and seasonal cycles sustain short-term engagement without distorting long-term reputation. Diamond tiers represent milestone score thresholds that become increasingly selective at higher levels.

Phase 1 operates as a fully simulated social competition platform. Participation is accessed through non-transferable Fugazi Tokens, which provide match entry only and do not influence competitive outcomes. No custody, wagering, or financial settlement occurs.

As participation density scales, Fugazi compounds into a durable competitive infrastructure: a longitudinal dataset of standardized decision performance across time horizons. This dataset strengthens ranking convergence, improves matchmaking precision, and enhances institutional credibility.

Real-stakes competition is treated as forward-looking and structurally independent. While real-stakes offers additional product appeal and revenue faucet, Fugazi's success does not depend on financial escalation. It depends on competitive integrity, retention durability, and signal reliability.

Fugazi is not a trading platform.  
It is not a prediction market.  
It is not a brokerage.  
It is a competitive and socially engaging measurement system for market skill.

Fugazi is a skill-based competition platform where participants prove market decision-making ability through structured, head-to-head matches built on real-world market data.

Markets provide the dynamic environment.  
Fugazi provides the control system.

By standardizing:

- Market universe
- Time horizon
- Portfolio constraints
- Scoring methodology

Fugazi ensures that outcomes reflect relative decision quality — not capital size, leverage access, execution latency, or infrastructure advantages.

Every match follows a deterministic lifecycle:

- Challenge creation under predefined ruleset
- Opponent acceptance and synchronized lock
- Active competition window
- Algorithmic settlement using archived price snapshots
- Ranking update under fixed formula
- Post-match performance analysis

The system produces immediate feedback while contributing to a persistent, long-term skill ranking.

## Competitive Architecture

Fugazi supports three competitive formats:

- **Blitz (15 minutes)** — high-frequency core loop
- **Standard (1 hour)** — sustained session depth
- **Championship (24 hours)** — prestige, highest signal weight

All formats contribute to a single unified ranking system on a 0–1000 scale, with new participants beginning at a 500 baseline and stabilizing after a 20-match calibration phase.

Diamond-based tiers provide stable competitive classification derived from ranking and participation thresholds. Tier movement is intentionally resistant to short-term volatility, reinforcing reputation durability.

Weekly ladders introduce cyclical momentum while preserving lifetime ranking continuity.

## Design Philosophy

Fugazi is designed with institutional restraint.

There are:

- No financial prizes in Phase 1
- No wallet-based leaderboard display
- No outcome-based monetization
- No casino aesthetics

Competitive identity is derived from skill and consistency.

Match results are immediate, transparent, and reproducible. A structured "How This Was Scored" layer ensures outcomes remain explainable without compromising strategic confidentiality.

Trust is architectural, not rhetorical.

## Phase 1 Positioning

Phase 1 is a complete and self-sustaining product.

Participants use Fugazi Tokens — non-transferable, non-redeemable participation units — to access competition. Tokens have no cash value and do not influence ranking or matchmaking.

Revenue scales with participation density, not match outcomes.

Fugazi is designed to validate:

- Retention durability
- Marketplace liquidity
- Ranking convergence
- Abuse resistance

before any optional expansion into separate real-stakes environments is evaluated.

## Long-Term Value

As match volume increases, Fugazi produces a standardized, longitudinal dataset of short-horizon market decision performance.

This dataset strengthens:

- Ranking accuracy
- Matchmaking precision
- Competitive credibility
- Institutional defensibility

Volume and standardization — not financial stakes — create benchmark-grade signal quality.

Fugazi scales through participation, not capital exposure.

## Important Terms

**Liquidity (aka Participation Density)**  
The presence of sufficient concurrent players to support reliable matchmaking across skill bands and rulesets. Participation density refers to player availability, not financial capital.

**Competition / Match**  
A head-to-head engagement between players conducted under standardized rules using simulated portfolios, resulting in a deterministic outcome.

**Simulated Portfolio**  
A non-custodial, non-financial representation of positions used solely for scoring and comparison purposes. No real assets are traded, held, or transferred.

**Skill Ranking**  
A persistent, Elo-inspired measure of a player's relative performance over time, designed to reflect consistent decision-making quality rather than isolated outcomes.

**Social Competition Model**  
A monetization and engagement framework in which participation, progression, and reputation are decoupled from real-world financial value or prizes.

**Participation Monetization**  
Revenue generated from access, identity, or analytical enhancements that do not influence competitive outcomes or confer in-match advantages.

**Fugazi Tokens**  
Fugazi Tokens are non-transferable, non-redeemable, platform-bound participation units used solely to access competitions and features within the Fugazi platform. Fugazi Tokens have no cash value, are not a cryptocurrency or digital asset, and do not function as a measure of skill, performance, or ranking.

**Competitive Integrity**  
The assurance that outcomes are fair, explainable, and resistant to manipulation, collusion, or abuse, supported by system design and enforcement mechanisms.
