# The Core Insight

Market outcomes are a weak proxy for skill because too many external variables distort results: capital size, execution quality, timing advantages, access to leverage, and varying risk tolerance. Two participants can make similarly "good" decisions and still produce drastically different outcomes due to factors unrelated to judgment.

Fugazi is built on a simple insight: skill becomes measurable when the environment is controlled and participants are compared under identical conditions.

By standardizing the playing field — same data, same constraints, same time horizon — Fugazi isolates decision quality as the primary driver of relative outcomes. Over repeated matches, performance becomes comparable and reputationally meaningful. This is how mature competitive systems measure skill: not through isolated outcomes, but through repeated results against real opponents under consistent rules.

Fugazi applies this principle to market decision-making:

- Markets provide the dynamic environment (price movement)
- Fugazi provides the control system (identical conditions + deterministic scoring)
- Competition provides the measurement layer (opponent-relative outcomes over time)

The result is a platform where players can build a credible performance signal and improve through structured repetition — not by taking financial risk, but by competing.
