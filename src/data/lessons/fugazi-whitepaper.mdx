# Fugazi Whitepaper v1.0

## Important terms

**Liquidity (aka Participation Density)**  
The presence of sufficient concurrent players to support reliable matchmaking across skill bands and rulesets. Participation density refers to player availability, not financial capital.

**Competition / Match**  
A head-to-head engagement between players conducted under standardized rules using simulated portfolios, resulting in a deterministic outcome.

**Simulated Portfolio**  
A non-custodial, non-financial representation of positions used solely for scoring and comparison purposes. No real assets are traded, held, or transferred.

**Skill Ranking**  
A persistent, Elo-inspired measure of a player's relative performance over time, designed to reflect consistent decision-making quality rather than isolated outcomes.

**Social Competition Model**  
A monetization and engagement framework in which participation, progression, and reputation are decoupled from real-world financial value or prizes.

**Participation Monetization**  
Revenue generated from access, identity, or analytical enhancements that do not influence competitive outcomes or confer in-match advantages.

**Fugazi Tokens**  
Fugazi Tokens are non-transferable, non-redeemable, platform-bound participation units used solely to access competitions and features within the Fugazi platform. Fugazi Tokens have no cash value, are not a cryptocurrency or digital asset, and do not function as a measure of skill, performance, or ranking.

**Competitive Integrity**  
The assurance that outcomes are fair, explainable, and resistant to manipulation, collusion, or abuse, supported by system design and enforcement mechanisms.

## Executive Summary

Fugazi is a deterministic competitive platform designed to measure market decision-making skill under controlled conditions.

Participants compete head-to-head using simulated portfolios built on standardized real-world market data. Every match operates within identical constraints, identical pricing inputs, and predefined scoring logic. Outcomes are resolved algorithmically and reproducibly, eliminating execution advantages, capital asymmetry, and discretionary settlement.

Fugazi isolates decision quality.

Skill is expressed through a bounded 0–1000 ranking system that converges over repeated competition. A structured diamond-based tier framework provides stable competitive identity, while weekly ladders and seasonal cycles sustain short-term engagement without distorting long-term reputation. Diamond tiers represent milestone score thresholds that become increasingly selective at higher levels.

Phase 1 operates as a fully simulated social competition platform. Participation is accessed through non-transferable Fugazi Tokens, which provide match entry only and do not influence competitive outcomes. No custody, wagering, or financial settlement occurs.

As participation density scales, Fugazi compounds into a durable competitive infrastructure: a longitudinal dataset of standardized decision performance across time horizons. This dataset strengthens ranking convergence, improves matchmaking precision, and enhances institutional credibility.

Real-stakes competition is treated as forward-looking and structurally independent. While real-stakes offers additional product appeal and revenue faucet, Fugazi's success does not depend on financial escalation. It depends on competitive integrity, retention durability, and signal reliability.

Fugazi is not a trading platform.  
It is not a prediction market.  
It is not a brokerage.  
It is a competitive and socially engaging measurement system for market skill.
