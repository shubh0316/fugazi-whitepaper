# Fugazi Whitepaper v1.0

## What is Fugazi?

### 1. Overview

Fugazi has pioneered a new category of skill-based competition built directly on real crypto market data, where volatility becomes the playing field and decision-making skill determines the outcome.

The platform transforms short-horizon market volatility into a structured competitive arena where participants enter matches and are ranked based on relative portfolio performance under identical conditions. Reputation is earned transparently through measurable performance rather than capital size or market access.

Fugazi is not a trading platform, not a prediction market, and does not facilitate the purchase, sale, or custody of digital assets. Participants operate simulated portfolios within predefined match parameters. Outcomes are determined solely by comparative performance between competitors over a fixed time window.

At scale, Fugazi establishes a standardized framework for measuring short-duration market decision-making skill. This framework produces benchmark-grade performance data capable of supporting rating systems, performance indices, and broader analytical infrastructure.

Crypto markets are inherently volatile, structurally fragmented across exchanges and liquidity pools, and frequently influenced by capital asymmetry. Large participants benefit from superior liquidity access, execution infrastructure, private deal flow, and informational advantages that materially impact outcomes. Even among retail participants, differences in tooling, latency, slippage tolerance, and capital size introduce variability that distorts performance comparisons.

While volatility creates abundant opportunity, there is no standardized competitive framework where short-horizon market decision-making skill can be isolated from these structural advantages. Outcomes in live markets reflect a complex mix of execution quality, capital depth, liquidity conditions, and timing randomness — making it difficult to determine whether outperformance is attributable to skill or structural edge.

As a result, the industry lacks a controlled, deterministic arena where participants can operate under identical parameters and be evaluated purely on relative performance during defined time windows. Without such an environment, short-duration market skill remains difficult to measure, compare, or benchmark in a rigorous way.
