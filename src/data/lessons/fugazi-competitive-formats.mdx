# Competitive Format Structure

Fugazi is designed around a tiered competition structure that balances immediate engagement with long-horizon skill expression. Rather than relying on a single match duration, the platform supports multiple competitive formats, each serving a distinct player intent while contributing to a unified skill rating system.

This structure ensures that Fugazi delivers rapid feedback and habit-forming engagement for new and casual players, while preserving deeper formats for highly committed competitors. All formats operate under the same standardized rulesets, scoring logic, and integrity guarantees, allowing skill to be measured consistently across time horizons.

Format selection is not arbitrary. Each tier reflects a deliberate decision about the relationship between match duration, skill expression, and user engagement behavior. Together, the three formats create a competitive ecosystem that serves casual participants, active market observers, and serious competitors within a single unified platform.

## Tier 1 — Blitz Matches (Core Loop)

**Duration:** 15 Minutes | Primary Game Mode | High Frequency | Immediate Resolution

The Blitz Match is Fugazi's primary competitive format and the engine of daily active engagement. Designed to deliver a complete competitive experience within a single session, it provides immediate gratification without sacrificing meaningful skill expression. Within a 15-minute window, skilled participants who correctly identify short-term momentum, manage portfolio concentration, and time rebalancing decisions will consistently outperform unskilled participants across a sample of matches.

### Match Mechanics

- Match window opens — both participants notified simultaneously
- Portfolio allocation phase: 2-minute construction window
- Live competition window: 13 minutes of active market movement
- Real-time relative performance visible to both participants throughout
- Deterministic settlement at minute 15 using archived price snapshots
- AI Coach post-match summary delivered within 60 seconds of settlement
- Total participant experience from match start to result: 16 minutes

### Strategic Purpose

The Blitz format isolates short-horizon conviction and allocation discipline as the primary skill variables. Rising market conditions reward decisive positioning. High-volatility regimes reward concentration management. The compressed time window eliminates macro trend noise, making relative decision quality within the window the sole determinant of outcome. This format generates the match volume required for the Skill Rating system to reach statistical significance rapidly, accelerating the platform's transition from early adoption to validated competitive infrastructure.

### Engagement Model

Blitz matches are designed for repeat play across multiple sessions per day. The 16-minute total experience fits naturally into discrete time blocks — a commute, a break, the period between meetings — without requiring sustained attention or schedule reorganization. This accessibility drives the daily active user behavior that social competition platforms depend on for retention and organic growth. Participants who complete 3 Blitz matches per day reach their 20-match Skill Rating calibration threshold within one week, accelerating competitive identity formation and platform investment.

### Notification Sequence

| Trigger | Purpose |
| :------ | :------ |
| Challenge Received | Opponent has accepted — match begins shortly |
| Match Live | Competition window is open — portfolios are locked |
| 5 Minutes Remaining | Final rebalancing opportunity before settlement |
| Match Settled | Result confirmed — AI Coach summary ready |

## Tier 2 — Standard Match | Strategic Depth Format

**Duration:** 1 Hour | Intermediate Format | Strategic Depth | Async Engagement

The Standard Match extends the competitive window to one hour, introducing strategic variables that the Blitz format's compressed timeline cannot accommodate. Macro trend recognition, news-driven repositioning, and momentum continuation analysis become meaningful differentiators at this horizon. Participants who can read developing market conditions and adjust portfolio construction mid-match are rewarded in ways that a 15-minute window does not allow.

### Match Mechanics

- Challenge accepted — match parameters locked at initiation
- Portfolio construction phase: participants allocate initial positions
- Active competition window: 60-minute market session
- Mid-match rebalancing permitted within predefined constraints
- Synchronized price feeds applied uniformly throughout
- Settlement executes deterministically at the 60-minute mark
- AI Coach post-match analysis delivered within 60 seconds of settlement

### Strategic Purpose

The Standard format measures a meaningfully different skill set than the Blitz format. Where Blitz rewards immediate conviction and allocation discipline within a narrow window, Standard rewards sustained judgment across a developing market session. Participants must manage position sizing across evolving conditions, assess whether initial allocations remain valid as new information emerges, and execute rebalancing decisions with awareness of remaining match time. This format serves the crypto-native user who already monitors market conditions throughout the day and wants a structured competitive framework for that behavior — one that fits naturally into existing market-watching habits rather than requiring entirely new behavioral patterns.

### Engagement Model

Standard matches do not require continuous active attention. Participants allocate at match start, check in at natural intervals, and return for settlement. Push notifications at the 30-minute midpoint deliver a relative performance update that re-engages participants without requiring them to monitor the platform continuously. This async engagement model extends Fugazi's accessibility beyond users with dedicated session time, reaching participants whose competitive engagement is distributed across a broader daily activity pattern.

### Notification Sequence

| Trigger | Purpose |
| :------ | :------ |
| Match Started | Competition window is live — initial portfolios locked |
| 30-Minute Update | Midpoint performance standing — rebalancing window open |
| 10 Minutes Remaining | Final positioning opportunity before settlement |
| Match Settled | Result confirmed — AI Coach summary ready |

## Tier 3 — Championship Match | Prestige Competition Format

**Duration:** 24 Hours | Prestige Format | Maximum Strategic Depth | Full Session Competition

The Championship Match is Fugazi's prestige competitive format, reserved for participants who want to demonstrate sustained decision-making quality across a complete market session. This format is not the core engagement loop — it is the arena where serious competitors prove skill depth that shorter formats cannot fully surface. Championship matches carry the highest Skill Rating weight and distinct leaderboard recognition, reflecting the elevated competitive commitment they require.

### Match Mechanics

- Challenge created with Championship designation — elevated entry threshold
- Portfolio construction phase with full 24-hour asset universe access
- Full market session competition window: open, intraday, and close conditions
- Multiple structured rebalancing windows across the match duration
- Seven-point notification sequence maintains engagement across the full window
- Settlement executes deterministically at the 24-hour mark
- Extended AI Coach analysis reflecting full-session decision patterns

### Strategic Purpose

The Championship format measures decision-making quality across an order of magnitude more market information than either the Blitz or Standard formats. Participants must demonstrate conviction management across multiple volatility regimes within a single session, navigate drawdown periods without abandoning sound positioning, and make late-match adjustments with full awareness of accumulated performance and remaining time. This format produces the highest-quality skill signal in the Fugazi competitive ecosystem and forms the foundation of the platform's most credible longitudinal performance data. Championship results carry the greatest weight in the Skill Rating system precisely because they require sustained excellence rather than single-session execution.

### Engagement Model

Championship matches are designed for high-intent participants who schedule competitive engagement as a deliberate activity rather than a spontaneous session. The seven-point notification sequence transforms the 24-hour window from a passive waiting experience into a structured series of competitive moments — each update rebuilding anticipation and reinforcing engagement. Participants who complete Championship matches consistently represent Fugazi's most invested user segment and its most credible ambassadors for the platform's skill verification thesis.

### Notification Sequence

| Trigger | Purpose |
| :------ | :------ |
| Match Started | 24-hour competition window is live |
| 6-Hour Update | Early standing report — first rebalancing checkpoint |
| 12-Hour Midpoint | Detailed performance summary — position assessment window |
| 18-Hour Update | Late-session standing — final strategic assessment period |
| 2-Hour Warning | Final rebalancing window approaching closure |
| 30-Minute Warning | Last opportunity for position adjustment before lock |
| Match Settled | Result confirmed — full-session AI Coach analysis ready |

## Unified Skill Rating Across All Formats

All three competitive formats contribute to a single unified Skill Rating that reflects demonstrated competitive ability across the full range of time horizons Fugazi supports. Format contributions are weighted to reflect the relative signal quality each produces, ensuring that high-frequency Blitz participation and low-frequency Championship competition both have appropriate influence on long-term rating trajectories.

| Format | Rating Weight | Rationale |
| :----- | :------------ | :-------- |
| Blitz Match | 1x | High volume, highest variance, core retention driver |
| Standard Match | 2x | Balanced skill signal, moderate strategic depth |
| Championship Match | 3x | Highest signal quality, prestige tier, low frequency |

This weighting structure creates natural competitive progression. Participants enter through Blitz matches — low commitment, immediate gratification, rapid calibration — and advance toward Standard and Championship formats as their skill development and platform investment deepen. The unified rating ensures that casual and serious participants compete within the same reputation system, enabling the platform's matchmaking infrastructure to function coherently across all engagement levels.

## Format Rollout Sequencing

Competitive formats are introduced sequentially to validate core mechanics before expanding complexity. Each format launches only after its predecessor has demonstrated engagement durability, settlement reliability, and Skill Rating stability.

| Phase | Format Activated | Activation Condition |
| :---- | :--------------- | :------------------- |
| Launch | Blitz Match (15 min) | Core loop validation — single format, maximum simplicity, immediate engagement data |
| Day 60+ | Standard Match (1 hr) | Blitz retention proven, notification infrastructure validated, fill rate stable |
| Day 90–120+ | Championship Match (24 hr) | Skill Rating system statistically mature, prestige tier demand demonstrated by user behavior |

## Format Design Principles

The three-tier format structure reflects four foundational design principles that apply uniformly across all competitive modes:

1. **Identical underlying mechanics across all formats.** Synchronized pricing, deterministic scoring, and unified Skill Rating ensure that competitive outcomes at every time horizon reflect decision quality within the same standardized framework.

2. **Skill expression scales with time horizon.** Each format measures a meaningfully distinct skill dimension — immediate conviction in Blitz, sustained judgment in Standard, and full-session consistency in Championship. The format structure does not simply extend the same experience; it surfaces different competitive qualities.

3. **Engagement models match behavioral reality.** Blitz serves spontaneous competitive sessions. Standard serves participants who track markets throughout the day. Championship serves those who plan competitive engagement as a structured activity. Format design meets users where they are rather than requiring behavioral adaptation.

4. **Sequential rollout preserves competitive integrity.** Introducing formats incrementally ensures that each tier launches into an established, functioning competitive ecosystem rather than a fragmented early-stage platform. Expansion is earned through validated mechanics, not speculative feature layering.
