# Monetization (Social Competition Model)

Fugazi operates under a social competition monetization model designed to support platform sustainability while preserving a non-financial competitive environment. Revenue is generated through virtual competition access and optional enhancements that are explicitly decoupled from competitive advantage or match outcomes. Monetization mechanics are structured to fund ongoing platform development, infrastructure, and content while ensuring that success within competitions is determined solely by player performance.

## Revenue Model

Fugazi's primary revenue mechanism is the sale of Fugazi Tokens — non-transferable, non-redeemable virtual units used exclusively to access competitions within the platform. Tokens are purchased in bundles at fixed price points and consumed upon match entry. They have no cash value, cannot be redeemed or transferred, and do not influence competitive outcomes or skill ratings in any way.

### Illustrative Unit Economics at Steady State

| Metric | Illustrative Estimate |
| :----- | :------------------- |
| Average token bundle price | $4.99 — $9.99 |
| Average token spend per active user / month | $12 — $20 |
| Estimated monthly active user target (Year 1) | 10,000 — 25,000 |
| Illustrative monthly revenue range | $120,000 — $500,000 |
| Blended platform margin (digital goods) | 60% — 70% |

These figures are illustrative and will be refined through v1.0 behavioral data. Token pricing, bundle structure, and consumption rates will be calibrated based on observed match frequency, session depth, and cohort retention during the free-to-play validation phase. The model is designed to scale linearly with participation density — as match volume increases, token consumption increases proportionally without requiring additional marginal cost.

## Secondary Revenue Streams

In addition to virtual token sales, Fugazi may offer optional paid features that enhance the competitive experience without affecting outcomes:

- Cosmetic profile customization and visual identity badges
- Expanded performance analytics and match breakdowns
- Enhanced match history, replay, and archival tools
- Seasonal passes tied to competitive cycles and status recognition
- Premium AI Coach analysis depth for completed match history

All secondary monetization is explicitly decoupled from competitive advantage. Purchases do not influence scoring, matchmaking, or skill rating calculations. Competitive integrity is preserved by ensuring that success is determined solely by performance within the match environment.

## Why This Model Works at Scale

The social competition monetization model has several structural advantages over outcome-based revenue models. Revenue scales with engagement rather than competitive results, meaning the platform's financial interests are aligned with player activity rather than player outcomes. High-frequency Blitz match participants generate consistent token consumption across multiple daily sessions. As participation density increases, token velocity increases proportionally, compounding revenue without requiring changes to the underlying monetization structure.

This model allows Fugazi to generate revenue from day one of the paid token launch while maintaining a clear and defensible distinction between competition, progression, and financial value.
