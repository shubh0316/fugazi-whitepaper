# Monetization (Social Competition Model)

Fugazi operates under a social competition monetization model designed to support platform sustainability while preserving a fully simulated competitive environment.

Phase 1 contains:

- No real-money wagering
- No asset custody
- No financial prizes
- No withdrawal mechanics

Revenue is generated through access and enhancement — not outcomes.

Success within competition is determined exclusively by performance under standardized rulesets.

## Fugazi Tokens — Participation Access Units

Fugazi Tokens are:

- Non-transferable
- Non-redeemable
- Platform-bound
- Without cash value
- Not a cryptocurrency
- Not a digital asset

Tokens function solely as participation units used to enter competitions.

They do not:

- Influence scoring
- Influence matchmaking
- Influence ranking
- Influence tier eligibility
- Influence leaderboard placement

They provide access only.

## Simulated Wallet Structure

Each user account includes a private simulated wallet that reflects:

- Token inventory
- Entry consumption history
- Participation usage

Wallet balances are strictly private.

They are not:

- Displayed publicly
- Used as ranking signals
- Included in leaderboards
- Used as status indicators

Competitive prestige derives from ranking and tier — not wallet size.

## Entry Model

Matches require token-based entry.

Entry functions as:

- A participation commitment mechanism
- A friction filter to discourage spam
- A revenue mechanism aligned with engagement

Entry does not:

- Modify ranking weight
- Alter scoring
- Adjust matchmaking priority
- Increase competitive advantage

All players compete under identical simulated portfolio conditions regardless of token consumption.

## Familiarity Without Financial Framing

Fugazi is intentionally designed to feel structurally familiar to market-native users without introducing real financial exposure.

This includes:

- Portfolio-style allocation interfaces
- Performance tracking visuals
- Market-based environment

However:

- No financial gain or loss occurs
- No asset transfer takes place
- No wallet balance represents real-world value

The interface communicates competitive structure, not financial speculation.

## Optional Enhancements (Non-Competitive)

Fugazi may offer optional paid features that enhance the competitive experience without altering outcomes.

Examples:

- Cosmetic profile customization
- Diamond display refinements
- Expanded performance analytics
- Extended AI Coach breakdown depth
- Advanced historical analytics
- Seasonal identity badges
- Pro membership (green shield indicator)

All enhancements are:

- Decoupled from scoring
- Decoupled from matchmaking
- Decoupled from ranking movement

Status must be earned through performance.

## Revenue Alignment Principle

Fugazi's financial incentives align with participation density — not match outcomes.

The platform benefits when:

- More matches occur
- Participation frequency increases
- Engagement depth increases

The platform does not benefit from:

- Individual losses
- Specific outcomes
- Ranking changes
- Tier movement

This structural alignment protects competitive integrity and user trust.

## Unit Economics (Illustrative, Not Guaranteed)

Illustrative steady-state assumptions:

- Average token bundle price: $4.99 — $9.99
- Average monthly token spend per active user: $12 — $20
- Target MAU (Year 1): 10,000 — 25,000
- Blended digital margin: 60% — 70%

These figures are illustrative and subject to calibration based on:

- Match frequency
- Session depth
- Retention metrics
- Participation density

Pricing structure may evolve based on empirical behavior.

## Phase 2 Optional Expansion (Explicitly Gated)

A real-stakes competitive product may be evaluated only after:

- Demonstrated retention durability
- Proven ranking convergence
- Stable participation density
- Verified integrity safeguards

Phase 2 would be:

- Structurally separate
- Jurisdiction-gated
- Legally independent
- Not required for Fugazi success

Phase 1 is complete and sustainable independently.

## Competitive Integrity Safeguard

Monetization mechanics must never:

- Incentivize outcome manipulation
- Encourage artificial match creation
- Bias matchmaking
- Distort ranking movement

If monetization pressures conflict with integrity, integrity prevails.
