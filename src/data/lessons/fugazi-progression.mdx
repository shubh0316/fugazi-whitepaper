# Progression, Status, and Incentives

Fugazi is designed to reward sustained competitive performance, disciplined participation, and long-term skill development. Progression is expressed through ranking, tier identity, and leaderboard positioning — not financial reward or artificial gamification mechanics.

Status within Fugazi is earned through repeated performance under standardized conditions. It is persistent, visible, and defensible.

## Core Progression Signals

Fugazi progression is built on four primary signals:

- **Skill Ranking (0–1000)** — persistent, lifetime measurement
- **Diamond Tier Identity** — stable competitive classification
- **Weekly Ladder Position** — short-cycle competitive ranking
- **Match History Archive** — permanent performance record

These signals operate at different time horizons:

- Ranking reflects long-term ability
- Diamond tier reflects demonstrated maturity + participation
- Weekly ladder reflects short-term momentum
- Match history reflects total body of work

Together, they create layered competitive identity without reliance on financial stakes.

## Diamond Tier Framework

Fugazi replaces traditional metal-based ranking systems with a diamond-based tier architecture.

Each tier is represented by a distinct, flat, monochrome diamond identity designed for:

- Small-scale visibility (profile corner placement)
- Immediate recognition
- Clean institutional aesthetic
- Non-casino presentation

There are no glossy finishes, animated flames, or spectacle-based effects.

Diamond tiers function as competitive identity markers — not cosmetic status purchases.

### Tier Advancement Criteria

Advancement requires:

- Meeting a defined ranking threshold
- Achieving a minimum win count
- Creating a minimum number of matches

The "matches created" requirement ensures participants contribute to participation density, reinforcing marketplace liquidity.

Tier movement is intentionally stable:

- Promotion requires threshold confirmation
- Demotion requires sustained underperformance
- Short-term variance does not cause immediate tier swings

Diamond identity must feel earned and defendable.

## Leaderboard Architecture

Fugazi operates two complementary leaderboard systems:

1. **Lifetime Ranking Leaderboard**
   - Persistent
   - Never resets
   - Reflects absolute competitive standing

2. **Weekly Ladder**
   - Resets every week
   - Ranks players by performance within the weekly cycle
   - Does not reset ranking
   - Provides short-term competitive urgency

This dual-layer system preserves:

- Long-term meaning (ranking)
- Short-term motivation (ladder)

## Daily Top 10 Overlay

To introduce daily momentum without volatility distortion:

- The platform highlights the Top 10 Daily Performers
- This is a visual overlay, not a reset
- It refreshes every 24 hours
- It does not affect ranking or tier

This creates:

- Micro-recognition opportunities
- Short-cycle social proof
- High-frequency engagement

Without destabilizing long-term progression.

## Leaderboard Views

Leaderboard interface supports:

- Global view
- Tier-segmented view
- Weekly view
- Lifetime view

Users can toggle between:

- Global ranking
- Ranking within their diamond tier

This preserves aspiration while preventing discouragement from extreme skill cliffs.

## Public vs Private Signals

Fugazi separates competitive prestige from financial display.

**Public:**

- Ranking
- Diamond tier
- Weekly ladder position
- Match results
- Ranking changes

**Private:**

- Simulated wallet balance
- Token holdings
- Entry inventory

Wallet balances are never publicly displayed.  
Competitive prestige is based on decision quality, not bankroll.

## Match Result Display Philosophy

After each match:

- Result (Win / Loss)
- Ranking change (white numeric display)
- Subtext showing +green or –red delta
- Subtle animation
- Light haptic feedback (mobile)

No confetti.  
No flashing banners.  
No celebratory spectacle.

Tone: professional competitive validation.

## Shareable Competitive Artifacts

Users may generate share cards voluntarily.

Share cards include:

- Opponent username
- Opponent ranking
- Ruleset
- Outcome
- Ranking change
- Timestamp

Share is optional.  
The system does not incentivize sharing through rewards.  
Social proof is organic.

## Pro Membership Signal

Pro membership introduces analytical depth and identity enhancement without competitive advantage.

Pro includes:

- Expanded performance analytics
- Extended match history tools
- Deeper AI Coach breakdown
- Enhanced statistical views

**Visual Signal:**  
A subtle branded green shield displayed in the upper-left of the profile image.

This indicates platform commitment, not competitive superiority.  
Diamond remains the primary competitive signal.  
Shield indicates invested competitor.

## Psychological Framing

Fugazi avoids:

- Casino aesthetics
- Artificial scarcity gimmicks
- Loud tier promotions
- Flash-driven reward loops

Instead, it reinforces:

- Competitive authority
- Measured progression
- Reputation durability
- Earned status

Players defend identity.  
They do not chase spectacle.

## Incentive Alignment

Progression is designed so that:

- Winning increases ranking
- Consistency increases tier stability
- Participation increases marketplace health
- Social visibility increases distribution
- Monetization remains decoupled from outcome

The system rewards skill, discipline, and contribution.  
Not spending.

## Fugazi Tokens

Fugazi Tokens function as platform access instruments required to initiate matches. Tokens are non-transferable, non-redeemable, and carry no monetary value.

## Daily Token Allocation

Each participant receives three free (3) Fugazi Tokens every 24-hour cycle. Tokens expire after 24 hours and do not accumulate. Daily Tokens are consumed prior to any purchased Tokens.

## Tier-Based Token Requirements

The number of Fugazi Tokens required to initiate a match increases by Diamond tier, reinforcing competitive seriousness at elevated levels.

Token requirements do not influence ranking, settlement mechanics, or outcome probability.

## Exposure Bracket

To preserve competitive integrity and prevent unrealistic capital distortion within the simulated environment, maximum match entry exposure is tier-dependent.

Each Diamond tier unlocks access to progressively higher simulated exposure brackets. This structure ensures that participants engaging in higher notional matches have demonstrated sufficient ranking stability and competitive performance.

Exposure limits are applied at the ruleset level and are independent of match outcome logic. Entry size does not influence scoring, settlement mechanics, or ranking delta. The winner remains determined solely by relative percentage performance.

Exposure brackets function as risk-governance guardrails within the simulation and do not represent economic privilege or mechanical advantage.
