# Progression, Status, and Incentives

Fugazi is designed to reward long-term improvement, consistency, and competitive discipline rather than short-term outcomes. Progression is expressed through visible status, skill ratings, and historical performance records that accumulate over repeated competition. Because these signals are persistent and publicly comparable, players are incentivized to protect their reputation by playing consistently and within the rules rather than chasing isolated wins. This design shifts motivation away from short-horizon outcomes and toward mastery, learning, and sustained engagement. By anchoring incentives in earned status and longitudinal performance rather than financial reward, Fugazi creates a competitive environment where improvement and discipline drive retention.

## Key Progression Mechanisms

- **Skill Ratings** — a persistent measure of competitive performance that updates after every match
- **Leaderboards** — ranked views by season, ruleset, and market universe
- **Competitive Tiers** — defined rating bands that signal experience and mastery
- **Match History** — a permanent archive of past competitions and results

## Seasons

Seasons introduce natural competitive cycles, allowing players to benchmark their improvement over time while preserving lifetime performance records. Seasonal resets are structured to maintain continuity in skill ratings while refreshing leaderboard competition.

## Earned Status

Status in Fugazi is earned, not purchased. Ratings, titles, and leaderboard placement reflect demonstrated performance against real opponents under standardized conditions. This creates reputational value that players are incentivized to protect, reinforcing fair play and repeat engagement.

By emphasizing progression and status over monetary reward, Fugazi fosters a competitive environment where improvement, learning, and consistency are the primary drivers of participation.
