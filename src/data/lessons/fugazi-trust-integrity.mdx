# Trust, Fairness, and Integrity

Trust and fairness are structural requirements within Fugazi's competitive system. Every component of match execution, scoring, and ranking movement is designed to ensure outcomes are deterministic, reproducible, and resistant to manipulation.

Competitive legitimacy depends not only on fairness being present, but on fairness being visible and explainable.

## Deterministic Match Resolution

All competitions operate under predefined rulesets.

For every match:

- Market universe is fixed at creation
- Time horizon is fixed at acceptance
- Portfolio constraints are fixed at lock
- Scoring methodology is defined in advance

At match settlement:

- A standardized archived price snapshot is referenced
- Performance is calculated using deterministic scoring logic
- Ranking movement is computed using fixed algorithmic rules

There is no:

- Manual intervention
- Discretionary settlement
- Human override
- Hidden weighting parameter

Given identical inputs, the system will always produce identical outputs.

## Immediate Outcome Clarity

At match conclusion:

- Result is displayed immediately
- Ranking change is displayed concurrently
- Performance differential is shown
- Opponent ranking is visible

No prolonged "processing" state is used.

Settlement must feel instantaneous and final.  
Delays in resolution create uncertainty.  
Uncertainty erodes trust.

## "How This Was Scored" Transparency Layer

Every match result includes an expandable section titled:

**"How This Was Scored"**

This section contains:

- Match start timestamp
- Match end timestamp
- Archived reference price snapshot
- Final simulated portfolio value comparison
- Relative performance differential
- Ranking delta explanation summary

This layer provides clarity without overwhelming the user during the initial result moment.

Transparency is available — not forced.

## Auditability

Match outcomes are:

- Logged
- Archived
- Reproducible

If necessary, match state transitions and price inputs can be independently reviewed and re-run against scoring logic.

An optional public-facing methodology reference may be provided to describe:

- Scoring algorithm structure
- Ranking adjustment mechanics
- Integrity safeguards

This ensures the platform can withstand scrutiny from:

- Competitive players
- Analysts
- Institutional observers

Trust must scale.

## No Mid-Match Hidden Information

During live competition:

- Both participants view relative performance
- Both operate under identical price feeds
- No participant receives additional data
- No participant receives advisory input

After match conclusion:

- Opponent allocations are not revealed
- Decision histories are not exposed in full detail
- Private strategic logic remains private

Fugazi preserves competitive confidentiality similar to poker:

Players see outcomes, not internal thought processes.

This prevents friction while maintaining integrity.

## Anti-Abuse & Anti-Manipulation Controls

Integrity safeguards include:

- Ranking volatility limits for new accounts
- Opponent repetition constraints
- Behavioral pattern detection
- Collusion risk flags
- Abnormal win/loss clustering detection
- Smurf detection heuristics

Suspicious patterns trigger:

- Automated review flags
- Ranking impact dampening
- Match eligibility constraints
- Account review workflows

Integrity protection is proactive, not reactive.

## "Rigged?" Psychological Safeguards

Competitive platforms must anticipate skepticism.

When participants lose, they may question fairness.

Fugazi addresses this structurally:

- Deterministic settlement
- Transparent scoring explanation
- Visible ranking logic
- No hidden multipliers
- No outcome-based monetization bias

If the system functions correctly, a player may conclude:

"This was difficult."

They must never conclude:

"This was unfair."

If ranking signal divergence or anomaly indicators exceed expected variance bounds, system parameters are reviewed before scale expansion continues.

Trust is preserved through architecture, not marketing claims.

## Integrity as Expansion Gate

Competitive integrity is a gating condition for all platform expansion.

If:

- Ranking convergence degrades
- Abuse increases materially
- Outcome reproducibility weakens
- Manual intervention becomes frequent

Then:

- New format launches are paused
- Expansion initiatives are delayed
- Integrity tooling takes priority

Fugazi does not scale on compromised foundations.

## Institutional Positioning

The long-term defensibility of Fugazi depends on its reputation as a neutral arbiter of competitive performance.

This requires:

- Determinism
- Explainability
- Auditability
- Non-discretionary settlement
- Monetization decoupled from outcomes

Competitive legitimacy compounds.  
If integrity erodes, compounding reverses.
