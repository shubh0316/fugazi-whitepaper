# Trust, Fairness, and Integrity

Trust and fairness are foundational to Fugazi's competitive environment. Every system is designed to ensure that outcomes are transparent, repeatable, and resistant to manipulation.

## Deterministic Rules

All competitions operate under deterministic rules. Scoring logic, match resolution, and rating updates are defined in advance and applied uniformly to all participants. There is no discretionary adjustment of outcomes, no manual settlement, and no hidden parameters that advantage one player over another.

## Competitive Integrity Principles

To maintain competitive integrity, Fugazi emphasizes:

- **Standardized conditions** — identical market data, constraints, and timing for all players in a match
- **Transparent outcomes** — clearly explainable performance results and rating changes
- **Auditability** — match data and scoring can be independently reviewed and reproduced

## Abuse Prevention

Abuse prevention is treated as a core system requirement rather than an afterthought. Safeguards include:

- Detection of anomalous performance or collusive behavior
- Limits on repeat opponent pairing
- Controls on new account volatility and rapid rating manipulation
- Ongoing monitoring to identify patterns that undermine fair competition

Fugazi's goal is to create an environment where players trust that success is earned, losses are understandable, and rankings reflect genuine skill. Competitive integrity is not only essential for player confidence, but also for the long-term credibility of the platform and its data.
