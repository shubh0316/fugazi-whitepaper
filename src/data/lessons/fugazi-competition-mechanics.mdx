# Competition Mechanics (No Financial Stakes)

All Fugazi competitions are conducted using simulated portfolios within a controlled market environment. Players do not trade real assets, custody funds, or interact with financial accounts of any kind. Instead, each match operates as a closed simulation layer that references uniform market price data while enforcing identical starting conditions, constraints, and evaluation rules across all participants. Portfolio actions exist solely as state changes within the match context and have no effect outside the competition. By fully separating competitive decision-making from real-world asset movement, Fugazi removes execution risk, capital asymmetry, and operational complexity, allowing outcomes to reflect relative decision quality rather than financial exposure or infrastructure advantages.

## Match Rulesets

Each match is governed by a fixed ruleset that defines:

- The eligible market instruments
- The competition time horizon
- Portfolio construction constraints
- Scoring methodology

At match start, all players begin with identical simulated starting conditions. Market prices are sourced uniformly, and all calculations are applied consistently across participants. This ensures that outcomes reflect relative decision quality rather than external advantages such as capital size, execution infrastructure, or access to leverage.

## Time-Bound Competition

Fugazi competitions are time-bound. Players make decisions within a defined window, and performance is evaluated only at match conclusion. There is no real-time settlement, discretionary adjustment, or manual intervention.

## Non-Financial Progression

Because no financial stakes are involved, competition outcomes are driven entirely by comparative performance and ranking. Progression is expressed through skill ratings, leaderboard placement, and historical match records rather than monetary reward.

This structure allows Fugazi to offer high-intensity, skill-based competition while remaining focused on learning, mastery, and long-term performance rather than short-term financial outcomes.
